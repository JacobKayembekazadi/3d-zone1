# ADR-001: Use of React, Three.js, and Zustand for 3D Room Designer

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The 3D Room Designer is an interactive web application for visualizing and customizing room layouts in 3D. The application must be highly interactive, visually rich, and run entirely in the browser with no backend or persistent storage. The team needed to select a technology stack that would:
- Enable real-time 3D rendering and manipulation
- Support a modern, component-based UI
- Allow for simple, scalable state management
- Be accessible to frontend developers familiar with TypeScript and React

## Decision
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **3D Engine:** Three.js, integrated via @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **No Backend:** All logic and data are managed client-side, in-memory only

## Consequences
- The application is fast, interactive, and easy to maintain for frontend developers.
- No server-side code or database is required, reducing operational complexity.
- All user data is ephemeral; there is no persistence between sessions.
- The architecture is not suitable for features requiring authentication, sharing, or saving designs long-term without significant changes.

# ADR-002: In-Memory Data Model with Three.js Vector3

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application needs to represent 3D positions, rotations, and scales for furniture and camera settings. The data model must be compatible with Three.js and support real-time updates in the browser.

## Decision
- All spatial data (position, rotation, scale) is represented using Three.js `Vector3` objects.
- The data model is kept in-memory and managed by Zustand.
- No serialization or persistence of Vector3 objects is required for MVP.

## Consequences
- Seamless integration with Three.js rendering and manipulation APIs.
- Simple, direct mapping between UI state and 3D scene.
- If persistence is needed in the future, custom serialization/deserialization for Vector3 will be required.

# ADR-003: No Backend or Persistent Storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The MVP is focused on rapid prototyping and user experimentation. There is no requirement for user accounts, saving, or sharing designs in the initial release.

## Decision
- All application state is managed in-memory on the client.
- No backend server or database is implemented.

## Consequences
- Fast, zero-latency user experience.
- No user data is stored or transmitted, simplifying security and privacy.
- Users will lose their designs when the page is refreshed or closed.
- Adding persistence in the future will require architectural changes.
