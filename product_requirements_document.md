# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature Name: 3D Room Designer Web Application

---

## Problem Statement

Users seeking to design or visualize interior spaces often lack accessible, interactive, and intuitive tools for experimenting with room layouts, furniture arrangements, and color schemes. Existing solutions are either too complex, require installation, or lack real-time 3D feedback. There is a need for a simple, browser-based 3D room designer that empowers users to create, customize, and visualize rooms quickly and easily.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to add, move, and remove furniture in a virtual room so I can experiment with different layouts.
- As a user, I want to change the color of the room walls and floor so I can visualize different design options.
- As a user, I want to select and customize furniture (e.g., color) so I can personalize my space.
- As a user, I want to switch between different camera views so I can see my room from multiple perspectives.
- As a user, I want to apply room presets so I can quickly start with a pre-designed layout.
- As a user, I want the application to be fast and responsive so my design experience is smooth.
- As a user, I want to use the tool without creating an account or installing software.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Room Visualization**
   - Render a 3D room with walls, floor, and window.
   - Allow users to orbit, pan, and zoom the camera.
   - Provide multiple camera presets (isometric, front, side, top).

2. **Furniture Management**
   - Display a sidebar with categorized furniture options.
   - Allow users to add furniture to the room by selecting from the sidebar.
   - Enable selection of furniture in the 3D scene.
   - Allow users to change furniture color from a palette.
   - Allow users to remove selected furniture.
   - Support multiple furniture categories (seating, tables, storage, decor, lighting).

3. **Room Customization**
   - Allow users to change wall and floor colors from a palette.
   - Provide room presets that load predefined furniture arrangements and settings.
   - Allow users to clear the room (remove all furniture).

4. **User Interface**
   - Sidebar for furniture, room, and settings.
   - Floating controls for camera and view actions.
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
   - Display instructions for controls.

5. **State Management**
   - All state is managed client-side (in-memory, no persistence).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Application should load in under 3 seconds on a typical broadband connection. Interactions (adding/removing furniture, color changes) should reflect in under 100ms.
- **Accessibility:** UI should be navigable via keyboard. Color choices should be visually distinct and accessible.
- **Security:** No user data is stored or transmitted. No authentication required.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Support latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
- **Responsiveness:** Usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reliability:** Application should not crash or lose state during normal use.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- User authentication or accounts
- Saving/loading room designs between sessions
- Exporting or sharing room designs
- Advanced furniture manipulation (scaling, rotating via UI)
- Custom furniture uploads
- Integration with external APIs or e-commerce
- Persistent backend or database

---

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement:** At least 70% of users add or modify furniture in their first session.
- **Performance:** 95% of interactions complete in under 100ms.
- **Accessibility:** Passes basic accessibility audits (e.g., Lighthouse score > 90).
- **Stability:** Less than 1% of sessions result in a crash or major error.
- **User Satisfaction:** 80%+ positive feedback in user surveys or usability tests.
- **Adoption:** 100+ unique users in the first month after launch.
